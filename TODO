So much I can not even start to think about what is missing here :)

Formally define the interface used - Change inheritance.

We do not support Graceful Restart for IPv6 (very easy to add - just not done)
Need a dict of AFI/SAFI returning the right function which generate the EOR for that pair (currently ipv4 hardcoded)

Correct Unit Testing.
 - Most of the use case have not been tested in production
 - Most of the code is not covered

allow reconfiguration (SIGHUP forcing a reload of the configuration)
 - reconfiguration alter neighbor list
 - reconfiguration alter neighbor routes

Add support RFC 3107

Graceful restart docs much clearer than the RFC
