Correct Unit Testing.
 - Most of the use case have not been tested in production
 - Most of the code is not covered

The code is currently broken and will simply keep the session with the peer UP (no announcement)

Perhaps ? move all/most the new_* function in protocol

allow reconfiguration (SIGHUP forcing a reload of the configuration)
 - reconfiguration alter neighbor list
 - reconfiguration alter neighbor routes

Add support RFC 3107
