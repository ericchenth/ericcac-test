BUGS:
 * Rewrite the unittesting which is really missing.
 * Write a correct documentation (argh ...)
 * Look at all the XXX: in the code
 * We have exact duplicate routes in the configuration, and they will be announced twice
 * reading stderr from forked process and displaying via the logger class

FEATURE:
 * When parsing routes, warns if a route use the as-path feature in a ibgp connection and has the ASN in it, it is invalid and the router will drop the route.
 * Some of the match condition of flows currently take list or numeric tests, they should always take both, refactor the code for it (ports for example)
 * UPDATE parsing is totally disabled as very broken ATM, the broken update parsing for ASPath assumes only one segment
 * Modification of the RIB from the code
 * Parsing of flowspec from process

CODE IMPROVEMENTS:
 * reduce to a minimum all the new_ and to_ functions and integrate them into protocol
 * Formally define the interfaces used (perhaps ...)

NOTES:
 * Juniper does not accept any holdtime <20 (double check again)
