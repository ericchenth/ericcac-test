Make sure that should the route delta calculation take over one second, to stop and resume it after sending keepalives
When parsing routes, warns if a route use the as-path feature in a ibgp connection and has the ASN in it, it is invalid and the router will drop the route.
Look at all the XXX: in the code
Some of the match condition of flows currently take list or numeric tests, they should always take both, refactor the code for it (ports for example)

Write a correct documentation

Formally define the interface used
Rewrite the unittesting which is really missing.
reduce to a minimum all the new_ and to_ functions and integrate them into protocol

Juniper does not accept any holdtime <20

UPDATE parsing is totally disabled, the broken update parsing for ASPath assumes only one segment

Calculing the difference between two configuration can take quite some time, possibly more than the keepalive if it is very low

Graceful restart docs much clearer than the RFC (but still not 100%)
