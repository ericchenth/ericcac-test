Write a correct documentation

Formally define the interface used

reduce to a minimum all the new_ and to_ functions and integrate them into protocol
some of the match condition of flows currently take list or numeric tests, they should always take both, refactor the code for it (ports for example)

Have an issue with hold time of 3 - see why and what can be done (4 is fine !!)
Juniper does not accept any holdtime <20

Graceful restart docs much clearer than the RFC (but still not 100%)
