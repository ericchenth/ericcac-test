IPv6 Support (under development)
 - allow connection to an IPv6 address (ipv6 native connection)
 - if we have some IPv6 routes and if the peer does not announce the MP_REACH_NLRI capacity, refuse the connection

add MD5 authentification support

allow reconfiguration (SIGHUP forcing a reload of the configuration)
-> reconfiguration alter neighbor list
-> reconfiguration alter neighbor routes
