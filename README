This program is a BGP route injector. It can be used to announce routes in your network.

Potential use are :
 - AS112 announcement
 - Injection of service IPs (customer accessible IP announced for the server)
 - Temporary route redirection (customer service suspension)
 - whatever you may find useful :D

Even if it should not be hard to use this program, This is not a "plug and play" application.
The code is deployed in production but if you are not ready to look into it to fix potential bugs yourself, do not use it.

As the program is not intended to receive routing information and perform FIB manipulation it only partially implements:
 - RFC 4271 (A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4), Obsoletes: 1771)
 - RFC 5492 (Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4, Obsoletes 3392)
 - RFC 4760 (Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4, Obsoletes: 2858)
 - RFC 2545 (Use of BGP-4 Multiprotocol Extensions for IPv6 Inter-Domain Routing)

This programs requires python 2.6 but does not have any dependences on any thrid party libraries.
