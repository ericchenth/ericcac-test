The tracking of route changes is likely to be totally buggy at this point

We are sending IPv6 or flow routes even if the capacity was not negociated at OPEN - we should report the problem and not send the routes

Need to forbid negative times in the configuration for hold-time and graceful-restart.
Have an issue with hold time of 3 - see why and what can be done (4 is fine !!)

For incomming messages:
 - ASPath assumes only one segment
 - all the XXX: and FIXME: in the code

The update unitest really need to be to be updated.
