The tracking of route is likely to be totally buggy at this point

Add all the optional Flag to the attribute defined as optional by RFC 4271
We are sending IPv6 routes even if IPv6 was not a multiproto negociated - we should report the problem and not send the routes

Need to forbid negative times in the configuration for hold-time and graceful-restart.
Have an issue with hold time of 3 - see why and what can be done (4 is fine !!)

For incomming messages:
 - ASPath assumes only one segment
 - all the XXX: and FIXME: in the code

The update unitest suffer from our bad includes (include loop), so update.py contains lots of code

It is possible to have two connections to the same routers with the same source IP, forbid it.
