Version 1.04 - 
 * Improvement: can now toggle debuging using environment values (DEBUG_CONFIGURATION, DEBUG_SUPERVISOR, DEBUG_WIRE)
 * Fix: some change to the AS_PATH generation code (some routers did not accept empty AS_PATH as it was encoded before)
    reported by: R.P. Aditya

Version 1.0.3 - 6th of January 2010
 * Fix: missing default localpref on IBGP session if not specified on the route
 * Improvement: more verbose messages in case of OPEN negociation issue
 * Fix: typo preventing 4 Bytes ASN to work

Version 1.0.2 - 22nd of October 2010
 * Improvement: only try to generate UPDATE messages if the configuration was changed (save quite some CPU as the algorithm is really naive)
 * Fix : a neighbor configuration change could have been undetected on SIGHUP/SIGALRM
    reported by: Yann Berthier
 * Fix : reloading the configuration did not detect the removed routes 
    reported by Renaud Chaput
 * Fix : a bug in the format of the UPDATE for route withdrawal causing Cisco (and not Quagga) to tear the session
    reported by Renaud Chaput

Version 1.0.1 - 7th of September 2010
 * Fixes an issue with some python versions (at least 2.5.2) when sending a large number of routes (several hundred). Some messages could be sent in multiple parts, causing the parser at the other end to barf (Thank you to Renaud Chaput for the bug report)
