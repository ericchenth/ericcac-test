Version 1.x.x - ..th of ....... 2011
 * Improvement: Allow to break route in more specific (ie define a /22 and get 4x /24 announced)
                This is useful when blackholing traffic to make sure no routes more specific are received from your network peer/transit

Version 1.0.4 - 8th of January 2011
 * Improvement: can now toggle debuging using environment values (DEBUG_CONFIGURATION, DEBUG_SUPERVISOR, DEBUG_WIRE)

    reported by: R.P. Aditya

    (issue 1) reported by Manuel Guesdon

 * Improvement: more verbose messages in case of OPEN negociation issue
 * Fix: typo preventing 4 Bytes ASN to work

Version 1.0.2 - 22nd of October 2010
 * Improvement: only try to generate UPDATE messages if the configuration was changed (save quite some CPU as the algorithm is really naive)
 * Fix : a neighbor configuration change could have been undetected on SIGHUP/SIGALRM
    reported by: Yann Berthier
 * Fix : reloading the configuration did not detect the removed routes 
    reported by Renaud Chaput
 * Fix : a bug in the format of the UPDATE for route withdrawal causing Cisco (and not Quagga) to tear the session
    reported by Renaud Chaput

Version 1.0.1 - 7th of September 2010
 * Fixes an issue with some python versions (at least 2.5.2) when sending a large number of routes (several hundred). Some messages could be sent in multiple parts, causing the parser at the other end to barf (Thank you to Renaud Chaput for the bug report)
